By identifying the factors that contribute to employee turnover such as age, education, department, and marital statusâ€”HR teams can take proactive measures to improve employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention. This project aims to build a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that visualizes these insights in a user-friendly format to support decision-making.
