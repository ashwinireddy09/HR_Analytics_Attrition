# HR_Analytics_Attrition

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze HR data to uncover employee attrition trends and provide actionable insights. The goal is to identify key factors influencing employee attrition such as age, gender, education, department, job roles, and marital status. This enables HR to make informed decisions to reduce attrition rates and enhance employee retention.

Questions (KPIs) 
- What is the total number of employees in the company
- How many employees have left the organization (Attrition)
- What is the current number of active employees
- What is the overall attrition rate
- What is the average age of employees
- How is the gender distribution among employees
- Which education level has the highest attrition
- Which department shows the highest attrition rate
- Which job roles have the highest attrition
- What age group experiences the most attrition
- How is attrition distributed by marital status
- Which department contributes the least to attrition
- What are the top 3 causes of high attrition based on the data
- How can filters (like Education Field and Department) help in understanding specific attrition trends

## Process
-Data Collection & Understanding
Collected HR data including employee details like gender, age, education, job roles, department, marital status, and attrition status.
Understood the structure and nature of the dataset to identify relevant fields for analysis.

- Data Cleaning & Preparation
Checked for and handled missing values and data anomalies.
Ensured consistency in data types (e.g., date formats, numeric fields).
Verified all columns were labeled correctly and standardized for analysis.

- Data Transformation
Created calculated columns (e.g., Attrition Rate = Attrition Count / Total Employees).
Grouped and summarized data using Pivot Tables for:
Attrition by Gender, Age Group, Marital Status, Education, and Department.
Job Role-wise and Department-wise attrition trends.

- Dashboard Design (Using Excel)
Built interactive charts such as:
Donut Chart (Gender Distribution)
Bar Charts (Education-wise, Age-wise, Marital Status-wise Attrition)
Pie Chart (Department-wise Attrition)
Tree Map (Attrition by Job Roles)
Displayed KPIs on top for quick overview:
(Total Employees, Attrition, Active Employees, Attrition Rate, and Average Age)

- Adding Interactivity
Used Slicers for dynamic filtering (e.g., Department, Education Field).
Connected all visualizations to the filters to allow user-driven analysis.

- Formatting and Visualization Enhancement
Used color coding and professional formatting to enhance readability.
Included icons and consistent font styles to make the dashboard visually appealing.

## Project Insight
- The overall attrition rate is 16.12%, indicating a significant portion of the workforce is leaving the organization.

- Female employees make up 60% of the workforce, with males comprising 40%.

- The R&D department has the highest attrition (66%), suggesting possible dissatisfaction or pressure in technical roles.

- Employees with a Bachelor’s Degree are the largest group leaving (99 employees), which may reflect the larger proportion of such qualifications in the workforce.

- Single employees account for the highest attrition (120 employees), indicating relationship status might influence retention.

- Age group 30–39 has the highest attrition (112 employees), likely because this age group is actively seeking better opportunities.

- Job roles show varied attrition, with some roles being significantly more affected than others, hinting at role-specific issues or growth opportunities.

## Final Conclusion
The HR Attrition Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of employee turnover across multiple dimensions. The analysis shows that younger, single employees with bachelor's degrees, particularly in the R&D department, are more likely to leave the company. These insights suggest a need for targeted retention strategies, such as role enrichment, better work-life balance, and growth opportunities. By focusing on departments and demographics with high attrition, HR can implement strategies to boost engagement, reduce turnover, and retain key talent.
